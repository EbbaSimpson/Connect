excerpt: "Kernelci.org has been hailed as “the most successful, public build and test\
  \ system for Linux, in the world\". To keep that reputation, there is a need to\
  \ do more testing faster, and we believe LAVA v2 will help us get there. Come learn\
  \ about the effort underway to transition the testing system from LAVA v1 to LAVA\
  \ v2, and the benefits that it will bring. \n \n In this session will we review\
  \ the new architecture for distributed testing that LAVA v2 will enable. Also, providing\
  \ status of what’s working currently, and what is still in progress. Come be a part\
  \ of the solution and help make the Linux kernel the best it can be!"
