excerpt: The Per Entity Load Tracking (PELT) is a key stone in tasks placement of
  the scheduler but suffers of some weakness when it’s not just bugs. During the last
  LPC, it has been decided to fix all pending issues of PELT before starting to consider
  another load tracking mechanism for scheduler and/or EAS. This session will show
  the improvement reached since the last connect and the LPC as well as the next ones.
  We will also looks at the RT class which lacks a good load tracking.
