excerpt: The Linux kernel is one of the most successful software-development projects
  ever. To get there we had to surmount a number of process and community-management
  hurdles, though. The result is a development process that is a wonder to behold,
  but it would be a mistake to say that we have solved all of our problems forevermore.
  We are facing a number of obstacles that, beyond limiting our future growth, might
  even threaten our ability to sustain our current development pace. What are those
  obstacles, and what can we be doing to address them?

★ Session Summary ★
The Linux kernel is one of the most successful software-development projects ever. To get there we had to surmount a number of process and community-management hurdles, though. The result is a development process that is a wonder to behold, but it would be a mistake to say that we have solved all of our problems forevermore. We are facing a number of obstacles that, beyond limiting our future growth, might even threaten our ability to sustain our current development pace. What are those obstacles, and what can we be doing to address them?
