excerpt: David always enjoyed mathematics, but America's space program together with
  'Star Trek' made him think that computers were really interesting and so he graduated
  in 1982 with a degree in Computer Science. The future turns out to have less flashing
  lights than he expected. At Digital Equipment Corporation he got involved in the
  port of LinuxÂ® to the Alpha processor. This gave him an abiding respect for the
  power of open source in general and Linux in particular. He worked on StrongARM
  before moving to ARM where he added tools experience. He's an ARM Fellow; which
  he says, "really means that I'm a techno-dweeb with a wide freedom to meddle."
