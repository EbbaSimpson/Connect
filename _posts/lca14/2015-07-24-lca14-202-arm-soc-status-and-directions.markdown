excerpt: 'This session will be about sharing current status and discussing ways forward
  in many areas: * Multiplatform images - how far are we willing to go? * Modernization,
  cleanups, refactorings - which of these are really worth doing? * Getting hobbyist
  maintainers to join the cause. * SA110 platforms: RISC PC, EBSA110 and Footbridge/Netwinder
  - are people using them, maintaining them and testing new kernels on them? If not,
  can we deprecate and delete the SA110 platforms?'
