excerpt: "In this session we will take a look at ETM/ETB and the Coresight architecture.\
  \ More specifically we will go over the current status of the upstream code and\
  \ recent contribution by various people. Next will be presented how we plan on integrating\
  \ all this work and some of the prerequisite we see as mandatory for upstream acceptance.\
  \ The presentation will conclude with an open discussion on our plan and take ideas\
  \ from the attendance.\n \n Our goal is to get as much information as possible from\
  \ people interested in the Coresight technology. We want an encompassing solution\
  \ that is flexible, scalable and usable by all."
