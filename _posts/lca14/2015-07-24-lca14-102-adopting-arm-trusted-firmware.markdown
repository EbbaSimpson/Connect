excerpt: ARM Trusted Firmware standardizes the boot flow and EL3 firmware for ARMv8,
  minimizing the porting and integration work SoC and Trusted OS developers. It is
  an Open Source project that provides a reusable, reference implementation of PSCI,
  SMC Calling Convention and, later this year, the Trusted Board Boot specification.
  In this session you can learn what the ARM Trusted Firmware does for you, how to
  deploy it on your own systems and how to engage with the emerging developer community.
