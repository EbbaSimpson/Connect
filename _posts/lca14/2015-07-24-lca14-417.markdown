excerpt: "Traditionally, allocators have been tied to subsystems in the Linux world\
  \ - userspace needed to decide which allocator to use in case there are multiple\
  \ available allocators for a given usecase. How does user space interact with the\
  \ kernel when memory needs certain hardware needs? Should user space know? Should\
  \ user space care? \n \n With the UMM initiative, there is an interest in creating\
  \ central allocator helpers that could help make various allocation\n idiosyncrasies\
  \ transparent to userland.\n \n This session is to discuss needs of different userland\
  \ use cases that could potentially benefit from this central allocator idea."
