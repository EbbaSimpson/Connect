excerpt: "In this presentation we take a look at Global Task Scheduling (GTS), a\n
  solution to support asymmetric multi-processing capable CPUs. More\n specifically
  we describe the solution, it's foundation, how tasks are\n scheduled in order to
  take full advantage of the asymmetric computing\n power and what areas of the Linux
  kernel have been modified. We will\n also go through a list of things to keep in
  mind when porting the code\n to a new platform before concluding with an overview
  of some of the\n tuneables that add flexibility to the model."
