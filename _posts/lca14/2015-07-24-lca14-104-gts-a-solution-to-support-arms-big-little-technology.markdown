excerpt: "In this presentation we take a look at Global Task Scheduling (GTS), a\n\
  \ solution to support asymmetric multi-processing capable CPUs. More\n specifically\
  \ we describe the solution, it's foundation, how tasks are\n scheduled in order\
  \ to take full advantage of the asymmetric computing\n power and what areas of the\
  \ Linux kernel have been modified. We will\n also go through a list of things to\
  \ keep in mind when porting the code\n to a new platform before concluding with\
  \ an overview of some of the\n tuneables that add flexibility to the model."
