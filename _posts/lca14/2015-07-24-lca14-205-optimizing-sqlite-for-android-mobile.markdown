excerpt: "Android integrates SQLite for database management, it\xE2\u20AC\u2122s one
  of critical components in Android as many applications use SQLite to store information
  in the database, as the content is stored in files on the external storage media
  both the retrieval and storing of information has to go through file system calls.
  The CPU should run the SQL queries to collect the data and provide to end applications.
  So ideally both the data transfer to/from external storage and CPU utilization can
  be optimized. This presentation highlights the possibilities of optimizations in
  SQLite."
