excerpt: "The Linaro RDK project team has worked on the migration\n of the Comcast
  RDK onto OpenEmbedded (Yocto Project). The RDK is an\n integrated Linux software
  bundle or middleware that can be accessed by\n operators to build their set-top-box
  \"software stack\". It is largely\n based on open source components such as Qt5
  and Gstreamer. The RDK was\n using a home made build system that grew into a very
  large project and\n became difficult to manage. The Yocto Project provides tools
  and\n methods to help build Embedded Linux complex distributions such as the\n RDK.
  Prior to the launch of the Linaro Home Group, the Linaro RDK\n project team throughout
  the 2nd half of 2013 designed and implemented\n a reference implementation of an
  OpenEmbedded based RDK distribution.\n As a result, Comcast has officially announced
  their plan to fully\n migrate the RDK to OpenEmbedded and the Yocto Project in 2014."

The Linaro RDK project team has worked on the migration
of the Comcast RDK onto OpenEmbedded (Yocto Project). The RDK is an
integrated Linux software bundle or middleware that can be accessed by
operators to build their set-top-box "software stack". It is largely
based on open source components such as Qt5 and Gstreamer. The RDK was
using a home made build system that grew into a very large project and
became difficult to manage. The Yocto Project provides tools and
methods to help build Embedded Linux complex distributions such as the
RDK. Prior to the launch of the Linaro Home Group, the Linaro RDK
project team throughout the 2nd half of 2013 designed and implemented
a reference implementation of an OpenEmbedded based RDK distribution.
As a result, Comcast has officially announced their plan to fully
migrate the RDK to OpenEmbedded and the Yocto Project in 2014.

This presentation will review the technical challenges and solutions from this project
