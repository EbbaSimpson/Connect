excerpt: ODP was announced at LCU13. An initial public release of ODP was published
  at the end of 2013. A second release is now being finalized and includes significant
  extensions as well as new implementations. We will review ODP progress to date and
  discuss what is now available, as well as the directions for further development
  and deployment in 2014.
