excerpt: In this discussion session we will cover the plans Linaro have for an open
  source TEE/TrustZone solution. We will tell you about the background and what our
  goals are. Then we would like to have a discussion with the audience to get to some
  kind of agreement and acknowledgement on what we are planning.
