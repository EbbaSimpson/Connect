★ Session Summary ★
Despite many respectable attempts made in past years, the IoT operating system market remains fragile as it emerges, which has been well recognized as one of major pains for the whole IoT community. 

AliOS Things, the little brother of Alibaba group’s OS product portfolio, is the new generation of IoT operating system dedicatedly designed to address the situation, which has been released in 2017 after years of internal development and already attracted lots of attention from the whole ecosystem since that. 

In my talk, I will give out the comprehensive introduction of AliOS Things, including its vision, design philosophy, target markets, ecosystems, and rich runtime and tooling feature set, and how it serves as an integrated piece of Alibaba group’s overall IoT strategy.
