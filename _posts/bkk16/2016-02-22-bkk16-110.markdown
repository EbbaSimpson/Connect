excerpt: Smart connected devices such as mobile phones, tablets and Digital TVs are
  required to handle data with strong security and confidentiality requirements. A
  “Trusted Execution Environment” (TEE) provides an environment for processing data
  securely, protected from normal platform applications. This talk is intended as
  an introduction to Trusted Execution, and the open-source Trusted Execution Environment
  OP-TEE in particular. It introduces the GlobalPlatform TEE Specifications, explains
  how Trusted Execution is implemented by ARM TrustZone and OP-TEE, and outlines how
  trusted boot software manages the secure boot of an ARM platform. Finally, it gives
  some pointers on how to get started with OP-TEE.
