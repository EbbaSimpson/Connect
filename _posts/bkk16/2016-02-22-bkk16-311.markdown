- What we mean by EAS core and how it's distinct from the other components - also why it's so difficult to get it merged. (This is driven by key partner concerns). - An update on misc work that's underway to resolve the upstreaming. - Misc load balance pathway enhancements - Wakeup pathway mods (cleanups, basic big.LITTLE capacity awareness etc) - Periodic load balancer mods. - Energy model expression (why this is important, partner perspectives/experience and bottlenecks) - Proposals to get an expression into the mainline - Optional boot-time auto-detection of capacity over-ridable by sysfs - Leveraging the merged power coefficient bindings - Leveraging the OPP bindings .. to effectively get to EAS' struct sched_group_energy. - How we are structuring things to ease upstream acceptance. What's helping, what's not, where partners can help.
