★ Session Summary ★
To fulfill our vision of having Arm servers everywhere and easy to deploy, Arm has created the Arm ServerReady Program where we have created the Server Base System Architecture (SBSA) and Server Base Boot Requirements (SBBR) specifications and the Architecture Compliance Suite (ACS) tools for the system developers to enable customers to deploy Arm servers with confidence that they work out of the box. In this talk, I will update you on the progresses we have made working with the partners in preparation of the official launch of the Arm ServerReady Program.

 

In addition, I will update you with the preview of the updates to the next revision of the SBSA/SBBR specifications. I will also provide an overview of the Server Base Manageability Guide (SBMG) that is to be released later this year and the related sample implementation in OpenBMC.
