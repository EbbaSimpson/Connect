excerpt: ILP32 is a programming model that may be useful on AArch64 systems for performance
  and also for legacy code with 32-bit data size assumptions. We combined ILP32 support
  from upstream projects with the LEAP distribution to enable experimentation with
  this model. This talk discusses the relative benchmark performance of the LP64 and
  ILP32 programming models under AArch64.
