excerpt: Linaro and STM implemented an integration layer between Chromium and Wayland/Gstreamer.
  The solution allows HW accelerated video playback, high performance GPU accelerated
  HTML5 rendering. The approach uses hole punching mechanism to compose the UI layer
  on the top of the video content. The Gstreamer Chromium plugin is implemented trough
  the Pepper API. The presentation will provide implementation details on the Wayland/Chromium/Gstreamer
  integration.
