excerpt: The fifth generation mobile communications network (5G) is not your “traditional
  telecom network” but optimized for connected and intelligent machines, having distributed
  cloud capacity and supporting devices ranging from gigabits per second to multi-year
  battery life. Software, connectivity and digitalization are reshaping both industries
  and society at an ever increasing rate and 5G is a strong catalyst. This keynote
  will explore this development, including how products and services are revolutionized
  and how many of today’s value chains are being overthrown.
