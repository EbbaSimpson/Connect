**Company**: Arm

**Job Title**: Principal Open Source Counsel 

**Bio**: Jilayne is principal open source counsel at Arm, where she advises legal, business, and engineering on open source related issues, provides training, and drives improved processes around the use of open source. She helped form and chairs the Arm Open Source Office. Jilayne participates in various open source industry groups, including co-leading the legal team for the Software Package Data Exchange® (SPDX), being one of the maintainers of the SPDX License List, and representing Arm on the governing board of OpenChain.  Prior to joining Arm, Jilayne was corporate counsel at OpenLogic, a provider of open source software support, scanning, and license compliance solutions. In her spare time, Jilayne can be found riding her bike(s) or occasionally co-hosting the geeky podcast, FOSS+beer.

**Keynote Title**:  “An open source developer and a lawyer walk into a bar…”

**Keynote Abstract**: When Jilayne is asked what kind of law she practices, she usually explains that she works in-house at a technology company, or for short, "I'm lucky, I work with a lot of engineers." The very nature of open source software inevitably brings lawyers and developers together (like it or not). In this talk, Jilayne will provide some observations, ideas and advice for both lawyers and developers on how to help each other do our jobs better. Jilayne will also share some of the lessons learned and efforts made to make life easier for open source developers at Arm.
