excerpt: As the earliest industry alliance based on ARM64, GCC is working on promoting
  the development of the green computing industry, conforming to the technological
  development trend of open source SW and open HW and bringing together the advanced
  global industrial chain resources. Linaro Hongkong Connect would be a good opportunity
  to introduce GCC to the industry, including establishment process, core work objectives
  and tasks, organizational structure and related business progress. We are looking
  forward to enhance the cooperation between GCC and Linaro in the future.
