excerpt: 'The 32-bit ARM kernel supports a wide variety of processors harking back
  to ARM v4 architecture up to the latest v7 SMP processors. This huge legacy forced
  kernel developers to adapt the power management code for the newest processors (eg
  v7 multi-cluster systems) to an infrastructure that was developed to support simpler
  uniprocessor (UP) ARM architectures, resulting in code fragmentation and lack of
  unified drivers.


  The brand new ARM v8 architecture provides kernel developers a clean slate to start
  developing new code, a nice opportunity to learn lessons from the past and bring
  about a kernel power management (PM) subsystem completely generic and up to the
  latest standards. This talk will provide details of the undergoing effort carried
  out at ARM to develop a kernel PM framework for ARM v8 systems, with kernel design
  details of the respective DT and ACPI implementations.

HKG15-108: Coresight Update and Next Steps 
--------------------------------------------------- 
Speaker: Mathieu Poirier

★ Session Summary ★ 
After an entire year of full time involvement of Linaro in the CoreSight area it is time to go back and look at what was accomplished, where things are, what worked well and where we need to improve. The presentation will start with a summary of what we accomplished and list features that were successfully pushed upstreamed. From our original planning some activities were carried out as expected, some had to be curbed for various reasons and other were added out of necessity. 
The second part will concentrate on the remaining work that needs to be done and lay out a rough estimate of the order in which it will be addressed. ARMv8, power management, trace decoding and the integration of various CoreSight functionality with other kernel sub-systems are very high on our list of things to so. We hope to receive feedback from the audience on the soundness of our approach and definitely open to opin
