excerpt: ADF is Android's Atomic Display Framework, which has been relatively recently
  developed and optionally replaces KMS and the framebuffer for forthcoming Android
  devices based on 3.10. It provides integration between Android's syncpoints to provide
  atomic display updates. This functionality is related to the atomic page flipping
  that has been proposed for KMS, but which hasn't yet been merged. This talk will
  cover a brief technical overview, and provide space for discussion as to how we
  should approach trying to unify these two implementations upstream, to avoid having
  totally forked display systems between Android and other Linux environments.

★ Session Summary ★
ADF is Android's Atomic Display Framework, which has been relatively recently developed and optionally replaces KMS and the framebuffer for  forthcoming Android devices based on 3.10. It provides integration  between Android's syncpoints to provide atomic display updates. This  functionality is related to the atomic page flipping that has been proposed for KMS, but which hasn't yet been merged. This talk will cover a brief technical overview, and provide space for discussion as to how we should approach trying to unify these two implementations upstream, to avoid having totally forked display systems between Android and other Linux environments.
