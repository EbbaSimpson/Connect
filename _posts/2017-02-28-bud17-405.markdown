excerpt: An example of a reference IoT product can be thought of supporting several
  core technologies such as IPv4/IPv6, 6LoWPAN, Bluetooth LE and also several protocols
  such as MQTT, CoAP and LWM2M. Additional requirements such as having a complete
  secure boot and execution environment, besides being able to be securely updated
  with FOTA support are also critically important.  This session will cover the development
  and challenges faced when producing a reference IoT product implementation with
  Zephyr, describing the state of the project, and the current gaps to productization.
