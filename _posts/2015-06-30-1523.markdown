excerpt: Android TV was a major announcement at the Google I/O event last June. With
  the release of Android L, the TV is getting the same level of attention as phones
  and tablets. As TV's and set-tops become computing devices in their own right, the
  situation is reminiscent of the mobile space in 2006; multiple TV's each with their
  proprietary solutions and multiple operating systems. Android L aims to create a
  seamless experience across all connected devices with one Android SDK for all form
  factors. Come and see the newest features of Google's latest foray into the TV space.
