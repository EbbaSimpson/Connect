14:30 – CentOS: Taking the Excitement out of your Development Process
Speaker: Jim Perrin, CentOS Project Developer
Abstract: Developers and end users have enough to worry about without the operating system getting in the way. CentOS has a proven history for the x86/x86_64 platforms, and now we’re working to bring that same level of dedication to AArch64. We’ll demo installation, development tooling, containers, and discuss how everyone can be a part of the future improvements.
