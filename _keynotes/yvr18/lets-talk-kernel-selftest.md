Kselftest started out as an effort to enable a developer-focused unit test framework in the kernel to ensure the quality of new kernel releases. Today it is an integral part of the Linux Kernel development process to qualify Linux mainline and stable release candidates. This talk will go over the Kselftest framework, a high-level overview of how to write tests that work well with the framework for effective reporting of results. In addition, Shuah will discuss how the framework is tailored for developer as well as users to serve their individual and unique needs and discuss future plans.
